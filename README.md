* __DataTrain/UBremen Research Alliance__:
  - __Operator Track: Data Scientist__

  ```
  A cross-discipline training program in “Data Train–Training in Research Data Management and
  Data Science” for doctoral researchers from member institutions of the cooperation network
  “U Bremen Research Alliance” teaches competencies in data literacy, research data management
  and data science. The program is associated with consortia of the German National Research Data
  Infrastructure (NFDI) initiative.
  
  In the Operator Track Data Scientist methods from mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence
  and computer science for data analysis and further data science competencies are conveyed.

* __Coursera Certification__:
  - __DevOps, Cloud, and Agile Foundations Specialization (IBM)__

  ```
  As an actively curious and continuous learner, I decided to take a foundational course on DevOps,
  Cloud Computing, Agile, and Scrum foundational specialization.
  The purpose for me as a data analytical engineer was to re-introduce myself to core concepts on
  agile software development and  gain new skills as well that could be used to bring about actionable impact
  on businesses, introduce oneself to current best practices as a practitioner, get introduced to the benefits
  of cloud computing, emerging technologies and the cloud services usage.
