* Coursera Certification: <span style="color:green"> <font size="15">  <u> __DevOps, Cloud, and Agile Foundations Specialization (IBM)__ </u> </font> </span> .

  ```
  As an actively curious and continuous learner, I decided to take a foundational course on DevOps,
  Cloud Computing, Agile, and Scrum foundational specialization.
  The purpose for me as a data analytical engineer was to re-introduce myself to core concepts on
  agile software development and  gain new skills as well that could be used to bring about actionable impact
  on businesses, introduce oneself to current best practices as a practitioner, get introduced to the benefits
  of cloud computing, emerging technologies and the cloud services usage.
